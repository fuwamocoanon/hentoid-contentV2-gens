# nexus-hentoid-contentV2
Uses my other repo / fork's info.json and converts to Hentoid's contentV2.json

Hentoid - https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid

Nexus Downloader - https://github.com/LetrixZ/hentainexus-downloader-userscript

1. Place into a Root folder with all books as normal folders (extract the cbz files)
2. Run the python scripts
3. Profit?

Nexus is made to handle the above script's json files. Anchira is made for the older yaml files.
